# Mods-Decompiler-GUI

Deobuscating and Decompiling all mods from mods folder.

This is a very easy to use application. It allows you to get decompiled and deobfuscated code of all mods from the mods
folder at a time.
The application also has functionality for merging all mods into mdk. This is necessary for the correct operation of ide
indexing.

Despite other decompiler/deobf tools this is independet from apis. It uses mdk to deobf mods. So it won't break after
mappings api changes like most of other deobf tools.
